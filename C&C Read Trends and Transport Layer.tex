RECENTLY EMERGING DENIAL OF SERVICE THREATS AND DEFENCES IN THE TRANSPORT LAYER

1. Seven Ws about the survey example (Who, What, When, Where, Why, for Whom, hoW): was from 2018 IEEE Canadian conference.

2. Essence (it can extremely difficult to give entire essence in only one sentence):Cover the latest strides in attack methodologies and related defence mechanisms specific to the Transport layer.

3. Structure: Intro, Related Work, Attack and Defence Taxonomy, Emerging Attack Types.

4. Some relevant details: Author doesn't create a new taxonomy, only simply uses it to highlight new trends.

5. Example (here one can call a figure that explains an example using a pseudo-code;  ideally, the same application case should be used for all surveyed examples): Didn't really have any good figures.

6. Pros and cons: Has good tables to define attack and defense metrics. Very short paper, likely due to it being from a conference.

7. My opinion of this example and its potentials:
Was not able to find the actual longer/non conference version of the paper. It was useful in the sense that it referred to an existing taxonomy, but this paper did not really evaluate in depth the previous work and take it to the next level. Also, the topic may have been very narrow, hence the lack of citations.
